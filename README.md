# This project was a demo project created for use for my dad and his business use.

My dad runs a busy general store and often he finds it difficult to keep track of every single order
(as the employees use almost 3 different forms of communication) for the store.

`I took it upon myself to build him an app that will hopefully satisfy everyone, in which I had the three main aims for this project.`

1. An intuitive UI that allows him to filter through orders using various parameters in order to plan his daily orders.
2. A backend that is capable of storing and serving images quickly.
3. Be able to access in store and at home (No internet capability as this is a private application)
