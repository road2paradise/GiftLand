My dad runs a busy retail store and utilises apps such as Whatsapp, Viber and sometimes pen and paper to order stock and inventory. 
I approached this problem with a solution of a web app / phone app in mind to address the need for a central platform where employees can simply upload a photo of the stock required instead of my dad having to filter through multiple applications and papers to collate stock and inventory.

This web app is hosted as a local webserver (Apache on Raspberry pi) at the store where employees will upload their photos to the cloud through the web application.
The web app is also hosted at home where my dad is able to access all uploaded photos.

## Initial Feedback

1. Push notifications / SMS notifications where a link to the stored S3 image for urgent orders.
2. Interactive UI - currently dull.
3. Better feedback when users upload - maybe include a list / number of files uploaded?
