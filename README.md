# GiftLand

My dad runs a busy retail store and utilises apps such as Whatsapp, Viber and other messaging systems to place orders for stock and take inventory.

The aim of this project is to create a platform where all of his employees (a mixture of devices and having limited access to high-speed internet) are 
able to upload their photos to a centralised location where he is able to place online orders for the products without needing to filter through
multiple avenues of order placements.
