My dad runs a busy retail store and utilises apps such as Whatsapp, Viber and sometimes pen and paper to order stock and inventory. I approached this problem
with a solution of a web app / phone app in mind to address the need for a central platform where employees can simply upload a photo of the stock required
instead of my dad having to filter through multiple applications and papers to collate stock and inventory.
